# Parallax
4X strategy game made with Unity Engine for my university as a diploma project

## Core Gameplay
The core gameplay is exploring new territories, expanding this territory, exploiting resources and exterminating enemies on map.

### Exploring 
At the beginning of the game the player is given a small territory to use, which will be a state to expand. Then, as the game progresses, player will discover new space objects, find alien civilisations, etc.
### Expanding 
By building so-called star bases on stars, player will expand his presence on the map. The more space bases player has built, the more territory he will have. Space bases can only be built on one type of space object - a star. Player can also expand by building new ships.
### Exploiting
By gathering resources from space objects, player will spend them on building of new ships and growing his fleet potential in that way. Game has 4 types of resources:
+ Alloy
+ Rocket gas
+ Red crystals
+ Minerals
Each type of resource is used to build different type of ships. Every ship has its own price.
### Exterminating
By exploring map player may encounter enemy fleet, patrolling his area. Every enemy warship has its range of vision, so when player's fleet coming into their sight, they instantly start to attack. Player can fight back with his military fleet.
